To run the application:

a) There is a precompiled jar that contains all libraries, to run, at the command line type:
   #java -jar gol.jar ..........n...0......n....0.....n..000.....n..........n..........n..........n..........n..........
   It will open the GUI application and you should also see the output at the terminal/console
   
b) You can open the project in eclipse and run it from there as well, although the console in eclipse isn't as advanced


To test the application:

a) You must open the project in eclipse and run each individual test file

The only provided tests are for the engine. At this time, the GUI can only be tested manually and visually.


OPERATION:

Starting up:
- When the application opens, you will see an empty grid of 8x6 (8 columns, 6 rows)
- If you entered any data at the command line, you should see it (if data is formatted correctly) reflected in the GUI and output
- If you run from eclipse or not from the command line, it should be a little faster since there's no duplicate console output

Playing:
- You can play by stepping one generation at a time
- You can select play from the menu for continuous stepping
- Choose stop from the menu to pause it
- You can clear the board from the Board menu, it works even while in continuous play
- You can select Random Fill from the Board menu to fill the board with cells placed at random locations, also works while running
- When the game is paused you can toggle cell using the mouse by clicking on the cell you want to set or clear

Options:
- You can set the stepping speed by choosing Set Speed from the options menu. A value of 1 is the same as one step per second,
  a value of 2 is two steps per second and so on
- You can input cells at specific locations by selecting Input Cells from the options menu

DATA FORMAT:
- only characters allowed are { '.', '0', 'n' } . = empty cell, 0 = live cell, n = new line
- make sure all lines are the same length, though both columns and rows can be larger than 8x6

FUTURE VERSION:
- Selectable colors for: background, grid and cells
- Disable console output for increased speed
- Save state and Load state for game interruption and restart to survive application restart
- Predefined cell groups that can be placed at specific locations, in order to study the work from others
- Prettier GUI with a more modern look and feel
