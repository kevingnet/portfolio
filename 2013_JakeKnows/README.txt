LIST OF APPS:

    - Web App and Engine: System Service that provides data to the Web App, a Web Bot collects information about users on the web, from varous sites and calculates how trustworthy the user identiy is based on the data found. Android and iPhone apps were developed by another team, and these apps interfaced with the backend. The backend was always ready with the data to be served, via caching and other mechanisms, so that a web call would be orders of magnitude faster as opposed to the usual web apps that get the data as needed, for each call. 
    - Sony App: Provide Job Aplicants with Access to Sony Jobs Database and Apply for Jobs. This application was developed very fast in a matter of 3 or 4 weeks to deployment, sold to sony. The application used the code generators and the code base from the app above so code reuse was at a maximum.
