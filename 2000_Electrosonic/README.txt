LIST OF APPS:

    - CommLib: DLL, rewrote winsock to handle double buffering for better performance, and because of some bugs
    - MonitorDLL: DLL to monitor computers, servers or other devices through CommLib Winsock TCP/IP
    - LiquidAudio streaming control: I designed it as an ActiveX control, it was used to stream audio
    - SCAN Application and related tools
    - ESCAN: 2nd version of the Scheduler. The scheduler allows one to visually script and schedule devices to operate locally or remote, including sending commands through email.
    - SiteLinx: connect two ESCAN servers through email, and send/execute scheduler commands for remote control
    - PC_Monitor: Win32 app to monitor a PC, it interfaced with the scheduler so as to report events
    - PC_Server: Win32 app to monitor a Video Server, it interfaced with the scheduler so as to report events
    - DeviceSimulator: Create devices to testing or for simulation of absent devices so that the scheduler can operate prior to installation at sites
    - XML ActiveX control: used to import data from a database and export to xml files. Very early one of the first xml systems.
    - Email ActiveX control: used to send/read email
    
    - Custom Applications: Developed for various clients, such as Voting System for the SHOA Foundation, Event generation devices for AMNH, etc...

WORK PERFORMED:

    - Designed, coded, tested, profiled and documented applications and tools and proposed changes and additions. Responsible for full development cycle. Worked in a team environments. Served as mentor to other programmers and technicians.
    - Conceived, designed and developed application for remote control and monitoring using C++, COM+, MAPI, TAPI, RAS.
    - Improved serial port and internet connectivity DLL which provided support for most applications. Developed second version, maximized capacity and transfer speed using C++, raw sockets, multi-threading, network events and double buffering.
    - Took ownership of application that controls and interacts with network and embedded devices. Developed protocols, device interfaces, ActiveX and ATL controls; extended application's and device's capabilities. Developed second version with many enhancements: MDI GUI, scripting capabilities, XML format, device triggers, email reporting plus many others. Used Visual C++, WinDbg and DDK.
    - Developed applications, tools and controls to support projects: Database, printing, MPEG encoding, hardware programming, device driver interface for video hardware to output graphics and text to TV screens, magnetic cards scanning, touch panels, Real Audio streaming control and device.
    - Adapted and implemented systems and applications for: American Museum of Natural History in New York, Museum of Tolerance in Beverly Hills, The Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, The Shoa Foundation in Universal Studios and others.
