    - Set Top Boxes


WORK PERFORMED:

    - Developed, designed and coded software in a distributed team, agile environment for Linux and embedded systems. The system is embedded in a Set Top Box, it provides Closed Captioning capabilities. Redesign was done to provide exceptional performance eliminating memory allocation completely after initialization.
    
    My new design of the CC code, from a C code base, major overhaul to C++, plus numerous improvements, such as eliminating most memory allocations (all for packets, only alloc once during init)
