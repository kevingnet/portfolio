WORK PERFORMED:

Localization Team:
    - Web Applications Development. Object Oriented Software Development in Java and Python. Learned Google technology stack, several enterprise applications, including one with over 60,000 lines of code, web based and android in about 2 months. 
    - Reverse engineering of Java code. 
    - Provided enhancements and fixed issues in existing applications in Python. Used cloud technologies such as DataStore, AppEngine plus other APIs. - Developed new architecture, designed, coded, wrote unit, integration and performance tests, including database storage for a global impact in production application replacing the web based system of ~45k LOC with ~16k LOC in Java for the backend and ~6k LOC for the front end in Dart. Inclusive Role Based Authentication and Resource Authorization Security Module that I wrote in ~2k LOC. The new system provides numerous enhancements, including simplified workflow with very highly performant operation, saving the company about 1/2 million dollars projected for the first year, for vendor expenses plus great time savings for users. Security Module (RBAC, MAC, DAC, Authentication and Authorization,) Memcache, HTML5, CSS, Spring, Hybernate, JDO, Leadership in bringing a project stalled for two years, to completion in 7 months.

Maps (Google Earth):
    - Develop enhancements and maintain the Google Earth Enterprise and related products. 
    - Developed optimizations to python XML processing, decreasing processing time 11 times, this was a three prong approach: 
        - Rearranging python code to move the more likely branches to the top, 
        - Importing to postgres using file based process and 
        - Added C++ and Python code to calculate geospatial data, taking into consideration point invariant and therefore avoiding that extra calculation. 
    - Developed optimizations for C++ by using more modern libraries. C++, Python, JavaScript, Postgres, Image Processing.

Hardware Analytics:
    - Architecture and Design, Developed and maintained solutions for the Hardware Analytics Team. Used Python, Angular, JavaScript, Typescript, SQL, BigQuery, Microservices. 
    - Developed authentication and authorization mechanisms to enhance security and compliance with privacy policies. 
    - Developed solutions for auditing, automatic alerts. 
    - Improved efficiency and optimized solutions and applications. Cloud development using Borg and related systems. 
    - Documented system processes and help to on board other members regarding security and authorization mechanisms. 
    - Helped the new team to get a better grasp of the existing applications. Debugged and fixed any issues. Refactored and redesigned code.

Devices:
    - Improved Speech Data Collection Tools team to automate and simplify data collection. 
    - Created a testing framework for 1st and 3rd party devices. 
    Used Python, Java, Angular, Javascript, Microservices.

YouTube:
    - Architecture and Design, Developed and maintained solutions for the YouTube Team. Used Java, C++, Python, Angular, JavaScript, SQL, BigQuery, Microservices and other internal tools. Applications needed to be secure and privacy aware. 
    - Provided data pipelines to proprietary graphical query application. Mentored other team members.
 
Human Resources (Finance Department):
    - Designed, Developed and tested the new version of application for HR Team. Java and Micro-Services. Heavy use of dependency injection, patterns, Guice, protobuf, and other internal and open source tools. Application was highly secure and addressed privacy concerns.
